Tailwind CSS Issue Summary

tailwindcss being used isnt one from node modules, need  to installed manually separately

Root Problem: Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issues with your existing setup.
Issues Encountered:
Missing PostCSS config - The postcss.config.js file was missing, which Vite needs to process Tailwind
Wrong Tailwind version - You had Tailwind CSS v4 installed, which requires @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
Plugin compatibility - Tailwind v4's PostCSS plugin wasn't working properly with your Vite setup
Solution Steps:
Created postcss.config.js with proper plugin configuration
Tried Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin - didn't work
Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 which uses the standard tailwindcss PostCSS plugin
Updated PostCSS config back to use tailwindcss: {} instead of @tailwindcss/postcss
Final Working Setup:
Tailwind CSS v3.4.0
Standard PostCSS configuration with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins
Proper Tailwind directives in index.css
